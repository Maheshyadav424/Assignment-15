4.This Triangular Number Sequence is generated from a pattern of
dots that form a triangle. The first 5 numbers of the sequence, or
dots, are:
1, 3, 6, 10, 15

This means that the first triangle has just one dot, the second one
has three dots, the third one has 6 dots and so on.
Write a function that returns the cumulative sum of the number of
all the previous (including current) dots when given its
corresponding triangle number of the sequence.



Examples
triangle(1) ➞ 1
triangle(6) ➞ 56 (1+3+6+10+15+21)


ANS:

function cumulativeSumOfDots(triangleNumber) {
  let cumulativeSum = 0;

  for (let i = 1; i <= triangleNumber; i++) {
    cumulativeSum += i;
  }

  return cumulativeSum;
}

// Test cases
console.log(cumulativeSumOfDots(1)); // Output: 1 (1)
console.log(cumulativeSumOfDots(2)); // Output: 1 + 2 = 3 (1, 3)
console.log(cumulativeSumOfDots(3)); // Output: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6 (1, 3, 6)
console.log(cumulativeSumOfDots(4)); // Output: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 (1, 3, 6, 10)
console.log(cumulativeSumOfDots(5)); // Output: 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15 (1, 3, 6, 10, 15)
